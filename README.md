This code produces the non-anonymized version of the CNN / Daily Mail summarization dataset, as used in the ACL 2017 paper *[Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04368.pdf)*. 

This is a modification of the scripts to output raw text as opposed to tensorflow binaries.

# Instructions

## 1. Download data
Download and unzip the `stories` directories from [here](http://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/) for both CNN and Daily Mail. 

**Warning:** These files contain a few (114, in a dataset of over 300,000) examples for which the article text is missing - see for example `cnn/stories/72aba2f58178f2d19d3fae89d5f3e9a4686bc4bb.story`. 

## 2. Download Stanford CoreNLP
We will need Stanford CoreNLP to tokenize the data. Download it [here](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) and unzip it. Then add the following command to your bash_profile:
```
export CLASSPATH=/path/to/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31/stanford-corenlp-3.7.0.jar
```
replacing `/path/to/` with the path to where you saved the `stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31` directory. You can check if it's working by running
```
echo "Please tokenize this text." | java edu.stanford.nlp.process.PTBTokenizer
```
You should see something like:
```
Please
tokenize
this
text
.
PTBTokenizer tokenized 5 tokens at 68.97 tokens per second.
```
## 3. Process into text files
Run
```
python make_datafiles.py /path/to/cnn/stories /path/to/dailymail/stories
```
replacing `/path/to/cnn/stories` with the path to where you saved the `cnn/stories` directory that you downloaded; similarly for `dailymail/stories`.
